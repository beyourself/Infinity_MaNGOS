<h2>Auction House Bot</h2>

<p>
AI Playerbot has its own Auction House Bot integrated. It woks almost the same as the original auction bot but has some other features:
</p><ul>
	<li>Using Random Bots as bidders/buyers so you won't know which item was from a real player and which was from a bot.</li>
	<li>Market price calculation respecting current market situation similar to Auctioneer addon does.</li>
	<li>Price fluctuation - sometimes some bots will post/buy under- or overpriced items so you can make a profit.</li>
	<li>Total gold amount restriction - ahbot won't buy too many items until real players spend some gold on other lots. The more gold the players spend the more items it will buy.</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
Please note that by default the new AhBot is disabled and you need to disable the original AhBot and replace with the new one in the configuration file ahbot.conf
