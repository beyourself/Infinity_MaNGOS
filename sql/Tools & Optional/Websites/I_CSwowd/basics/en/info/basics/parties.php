<img src="../../../shared/wow-com/images/smallcaps/plain/y.gif" align="left">ou don't have to adventure alone in World of Warcraft. In fact, the game can be more fun when you join with other players. Quests that are too difficult alone can be surprisingly easy to accomplish when you group with other players. If you group with other players frequently enough, they might even become regular adventuring companions and friends.
<p>
<b>Creating a Group</b><br>
A group, or party, of adventurers can have a maximum of five players. A group is created as soon as one other player joins you. You can invite a player to join your group in three ways.
<ul>
<li>You can select the player, right-click on the player's portrait, and select the invite command from the resulting dropdown menu.
<li>You can type the /invite command followed by the player's name at your chat prompt.
<li>You can add the player to your friends list, then select that player from your friends list in the Social window and click the Group Invite button.
</ul>
Players you can see next to you can be invited by any of these three means. However, players that you cannot see, usually because they are far away or in a different zone, must be invited through the /invite command or through the Group Invite button on the friends list.
<p>
A player already in another group cannot join your group. If you extend an invitation to such a player, you will get a message back saying the other person is already in a group.
<p>
<b>Joining a Group</b><br>
If you are adventuring by yourself and are invited into a group, you can accept or decline the invitation. However, if you are already in a group, then you will be unable to join a new group until you leave your current group.
<p>
<B>Switch to Party Chat</B><BR>
Type "/p text" to switch to party chat. This allows you to communicate only with members of your party.
<P>
<B>Group Leader Options</B><BR>
Type "/kick playername" to remove a player from the party. You can also
right-click on their name and select "uninvite".
<P>
<B>Leaving a Party</B><BR>
Right-click on your player portrait in the top left corner. Select the option to leave the party.
<P>
<B>Super Groups</B><BR>
Players will also be able to combine parties to form huge groups for raids.
<P>
<B>Party Member Options</B><BR>
Select a party member's portrait and right-click on it to see what options are available to you. Some options are only available to the group leader,
and only when the party members are next to each other, such as trading and inspecting.
<P>
<B>Locating Party Members</B><BR>
The minimap shows little green dots or arrows showing where to find specific party members. Place your mouse over the dots or arrows to see who is who.
<P>
You can also check which area party members are located by mousing over their information box on the left side of the screen.
<P>
<B>Loot Options</B><BR>
When the monster's body sparkles you are allowed to loot the corpse.
<P>
There are several loot options/flags:
<ul>
<B>Round Robin</B> - Everyone takes turns in looting.
It is your turn to loot again when everyone has taken their turn in that "round."
This setting is recommended for most situations.
If a player bends down to loot a monster under Round Robin looting, then if they leave items on the corpse that they
haven't looted, anyone in the party can loot them.
Keep in mind that more than one person will be able to loot a corpse if the person currently looting already has enough of the quest items that that specific monster dropped.
<P>
<B>Free-For-All</B> - This setting allows anyone in the party to loot any corpse. You might find this option useful if no one cares who gets what, or
how often any one person gets to loot.
<P>
<B>Master Looter</B> - This setting allows the group leader to loot everything and allows the leader to decide if other members in the party are to get items, and what items they should get.
This becomes useful when very powerful items are dropping and people can't be trusted to pass them out fairly. Any time an item is distributed using the Master Looter system and the item is quality epic or above there will be a confirmation dialogue to confirm that the item is going to the correct person.
<P>
<script language = "javascript">
screenshotResized(1, 1024, 782, "en/index.html", "right", "Need before Greed", "");
</script>
<B>Group Loot</B> (default) - When an item equal to or above the threshold (details on threshold below) is on a monster that is killed, everyone gets a pop-up box on their screen with the item and pass or roll options and a timer. Anyone who rolls, displays a number between 1 and 100, the highest roller of all those who choose to roll automatically gets the item. Anyone who waits until the timer expires automatically passes. Items below the threshold are taken care of by normal round robin rules. If more than one player ties a loot roll, a random player will receive the loot. An interface option, "Detailed Loot Information" is defaulted to 'on.' If you turn it off you will only see the roll and Need/Greed option of the player who won the item rather than information for every player.
<P>
<B>Need Before Greed</B> - Same as group loot, except players who cannot use the item automatically pass.
<P>
<B>Threshold</B> - This just determines the level of items that are affected by the methods above. If a party wants to set the threshold to blue items and are in group loot mode, then green items that are found will be taken care of by the normal round robin rules.
</ul>
<P>
Tip: When a party member receives a loot item, give it to the party member that can use it best.
Party members can click on the [lootname] to see the stats of items looted off of monsters.
<p>
The Group Loot/Need before Greed dialogue will now show a golden dragon border around Bind on Pickup items.
<P>
<B>Party Experience</B><BR>
Experience is shared with other party members.
For a party member to get experience, they must be within a certain distance from a kill.
It's best to have players around the same level in a party, but players that have vastly higher or lower levels will still get some experience.
<P>
<script language = "javascript">
screenshotResized(2, 556, 556, "", "right", "Marks", "");
</script>
<b>Marking Targets</b><br>
Parties and Raids can mark targets for their party/raid in the gamefield. A party leader or raid leader/assistant can right-click the portrait of their target to select a symbol to associate with that target. All players in the party/raid will see the selected symbol over the head of the target as well as on the portrait of that target.
<p>
<b>Target of Target</b><br>
Players can turn on the "Target of Target" in the Raid and Party section of the interface options. When this is turned on, anytime a player is in a party or raid, it will show the portrait and health of whatever your current target has targeted. You can click on that portrait to target that thing directly or if you have the spell glove up you can cast spells on the target of target without targeting it directly.
<p>
<b>Resetting Instances</b><br>
The party leader can reset a dungeon instance from the interface. If the party has recently been inside an instance but is now outside of the instance, the party leader will have a right-click option from their own portrait (where you select the loot UI preference) that is "Reset all Instances". If this is selected all non raid instances will be reset for the party.
<ul>
<li>You only get the reset instance option if you are a party leader.
<li>The UI option appears if you are a party leader, you have one or more instances open, and you are not currently in an instance.
<li>The UI option is a right-click option off of your own portrait (like party loot options).
<li>You get a warning dialogue when you select this option asking if you really want to reset all instances.
<li>If you select reset all instances, all non-raid instances will be reset to their starting condition.
</ul>
<B>Combat Targeting</B><BR>
The party should always be attacking the same monster.
Generally, the party members should always be attacking the Puller's target.
Often the most powerful or deadly monsters are targeted first.
<P>
<ul>
<B>Use "V"</B> - It's important that everyone isn't attacking a different target.
During battle hit "V" to show the monster's hit points.
Always try to attack the target that is closest to death.
You can also use this for targeting purposes.
Click on the name of the monster you wish to attack.
<P>
<B>Assist - F2-F5...</B> Can be used to select party members. Use the F-Key that matches the corresponding player and then hit "F" to target the monster that player is attacking.
You can also go into the options menu and select the option "Attack on Assist".
Attack on assist makes characters that assist with "F" automatically try to enter attack mode against their new target.
This option might be good for a warrior, but might not be useful for a priest.
Communicate with other party members to determine who the party should be assisting.
<P>
<B>Tab and Shift-Tab</B> - Tab chooses and targets the nearest monsters and Shift-Tab cycles through the list of monsters from farthest to closest.
Use these buttons during battle if you need to target a nearby monster or cycle through the list of monsters.
