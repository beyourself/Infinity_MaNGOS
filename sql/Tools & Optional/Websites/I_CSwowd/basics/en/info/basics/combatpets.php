<h1 class =" title">Pets</h1>
If you are a class that uses pets you should learn everything you can about them, including how to best control them.
<P>
<h1 class =" title">Summon Pet</h1>
Once you are allowed to have a pet you need to learn how to summon it. Typically, you need to first get training to receive your pet.
Once you do that, a new summon pet button will appear in your spells menu. Hunters have to convert a pet from the wild with their special ability.
Drag the summon pet button on to one of your action bar pages, and summon your pet. You will now see a new mini action bar that is used to control your pet. This is your pet action bar.
<P>
<h1 class =" title">Pet Action Bar</h1>
Pet users get a special, smaller action bar they can use to control their pet. You can drag abilities onto this action bar. Your pet bar disappears when your pet dies.
<P>
<h1 class =" title">Pet Training</h1>
You can gain new abilities for your pet by visiting a pet trainer for that specific pet.
If you don't know where to find one, ask more experienced players of that class. The trainers are around, but they may be difficult to find. Try visiting a new town.
<P>
<h1 class =" title">Pet Location</h1>
Your pet shows up on the mini-map. The mini-map is very useful for keeping track of how far away your pet is as you travel around the world.
<P>
<h1 class =" title">Pet Death</h1>
If your pet dies you may have to wait through a cooldown period before summoning it again.
<P>
If you get too far away from your pet, or if the pet gets stuck, it will eventually unsummon. You will
have to summon your pet again. Learn to lead your pet around so it doesn't fall behind. Another option
is to dismiss your pet, and then summon it again once you've reached your destination.
<P>
<img src="../../../shared/wow-com/images/characters/ingame/gnome-crying.jpg" align="right" title="Oh noes!!!!!!!111eleventyone"><h1 class =" title">Pet Healing</h1>
Your pet will heal after combat is over. Also, you can heal it yourself.
<P>
<h1 class =" title">Pet Buffs</h1>
You can buff up your pet! Give it a shot.
<P>
<h1 class =" title">Abandon Pet</h1>
Right-click on your pet's name bar to see additional pet options. You can dismiss a pet
if you no longer need it or wish to switch pets.
<P>
<h1 class =" title">Pet Modes</h1>
While your pet is active you have several common buttons to control it:
<ul>
<table cellspacing =" 0" cellpadding =" 0" border =" 0">
<tr>
<td valign =" top"><img src ="../../../shared/wow-com/images/icons/35x35square/pet-attack.jpg"></td>
<td valign =" top">&nbsp;</td>
<td valign =" top"><span><B>Attack</B>: Select a target, and hit the attack button. There's a hot key to do it too. Look it up in the options/controls menu.</span></td>

<tr>
<td valign =" top"><img src ="../../../shared/wow-com/images/icons/35x35square/pet-stay.jpg"></td>
<td valign =" top">&nbsp;</td>
<td><span><B>Stay</B>: This is useful when you want your pet to stay in place. You can leave it outside of town or a building, go do your business, and
then come back to it. That way it won't be traveling around trying to reach you.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr><td colspan =" 3"><br></td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign =" top"><img src ="../../../shared/wow-com/images/icons/35x35square/pet-aggressive.jpg"></td>
<td valign =" top">&nbsp;</td>
<td valign =" top"><span><B>Aggressive</B>: If a monster comes within range of the pet, the pet moves to attack the monster.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr><td colspan =" 3"><img src ="../../../shared/wow-com/images/layout/pixel.gif" height =" 5"></td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign =" top"><img src ="../../../shared/wow-com/images/icons/35x35square/pet-defensive.jpg"></td>
<td valign =" top">&nbsp;</td>
<td valign =" top"><span><B>Defensive</B>: The pet responds if attacked but otherwise won't act.</span></td>
</tr>
<tr><td colspan =" 3"><img src ="../../../shared/wow-com/images/layout/pixel.gif" height =" 5"></td></tr>
<tr>
<td valign =" top"><img src ="../../../shared/wow-com/images/icons/35x35square/pet-passive.jpg"></td>
<td valign =" top">&nbsp;</td>
<td valign =" top"><span><B>Passive</B>: The pet just sits there and does not attack. This is useful if you want to stop a pet from attacking to play around with hate lists or for other reasons. It comes in handy.</td>
</tr>
</table>
</ul>
<h1 class =" title">Pet Control</h1>
You need to manage the hate of the monster between you and your pet. If the monster is attacking your pet is about to kill it then you
need to heal your pet or get the monster to attack you instead. You can transfer the monster over to you by casting spells on the
monster that really make it angry. You will have to figure out which spells do that.
<P>
If the monster is too focused on you, you need to stop attacking it and use whatever pet abilities your pet has to make the monster angry
enough to fight it instead. Learning how to properly manage monster hate can take some time. The goal is to keep both you and your
pet alive until the end of combat.
<P>
If you're in a party and your pet is attracting too much attention, have it stop attacking until the monster focuses on someone else in the party. Then wait
a bit longer and have your pet rejoin the fight again. That way your pet can continue to attack and live while the monster is attacking someone
else.
<P>
When you give your pet commands it will cancel any spells they arecurrently casting.

No.

<B>Do pets take up extra experience?</B><BR>
No.
<P>
<b>What classes get pets?</b>
Warlocks and Hunters can get permanent pets. Priests can control humanoid monsters as a pet for a limited amount of time.
There are other ways to get pets. For example,Engineers can construct pets. There are items that players can find that
