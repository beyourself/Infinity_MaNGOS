Now that you have entered the game you will find yourself in a new player starting area.
<P>
<B>Learn the Controls</B><BR>
You should first familiarize yourself with the interface. Be sure to look up the controls and read about tips for better controlling your character. After you know the basics, it's time to play!
<P>
<B>Find a Quest!</B><BR>
Quest givers have exclamation marks over their heads. Go talk to the quest giver by right-clicking on them. Go around to every NPC with a "!" above their head and see what they want you to do.
<P>
<B>Find your class trainer or go fight!</B><BR>
You might want to go find your class trainer, located in the town/area near where your character started in the land. However, most players decide to immediately rush out and start working on their first quest!
<P>
<B>Targets</B><BR>
Left-Click selects a target and Right-Click interacts with them.
<P>
<B>Health</B><BR>
You can eat some food to regain your health faster. Click on the food icon in the action panel across the bottom left of your screen and your character will sit down to eat. Food will not work in combat, however, and standing up or moving will remove the increased health regeneration effect.
<P>
You regain health faster when sitting down.
<P>
<B>Mana</B><BR>
You can drink water to regain your mana faster. Click on the drink icon in the action panel across the bottom left of your screen.
The mana regeneration will stop if you use any other ability or get in combat.
<P>
<B>Combat</B><BR>
You can cast spells and use special abilities on the enemy by clicking on the buttons along the lower left portion of the screen.
<P>
<B>Attacking</B><BR>
You can attack a hostile target by Right-Clicking on it.
<P>
<b>Selecting Aggressive Monsters</b>
<br>A target with a red selection circle will attack if you get too close.
<P>
<B>Leveling Up</B><BR>
You can learn a new talent in the talent interface. The talent interface is brought up by clicking on the character button in your action panel and then selecting the talents tab.
<P>
<B>At Level 3 or 4</B><BR>
You can go to your trainer in your starting area and learn a new skill. Your trainer is in the area near to where you started,
but you might have to search a little. You can ask other players for help if you cannot find them. The class trainer will show
your class name under their name. For example, &lt;Paladin Trainer&gt;.
<P>
<B>Reputation Changes</B><BR>
You can look at your reputation with different groups in the world in the character panel under the reputation tab. This will show what they think about you and how they will react. You can change your reputation through various methods in the game such as combat and quests.
<P>
<B>Looting Your First Item</B><BR>
Right-Click on a monster's corpse to loot it.You can then right-click on items in the loot panel to place them in your backpack.
After the item is in your backpack you can click on the backpack button in the lower right part of the screen to open your backpack and then mouse-over the item to see what it is.
<P>
<B>Getting Your First Bag</B><BR>
 You can put the bag in the empty bag spaces in the lower right part of your screen next to the backpack, and then click on the bag to open it.
<P>
<B>Talking to Other Players Near You</B><BR>
Hit the enter button, type your message, then hit enter again. Players that are near you will see your message.
<P>
<B>Sending a Player a Private Message</B><BR>
Type "/w playername message" such as "/w iko hi!"
<P>
<B>Responding to private messages from other players</B><BR>
You can respond to that player by hitting the "R" key to reply, and then you can type your message,
or by hitting "Enter" and typing /w (or /tell) &lt;theirname&gt; and then the message.
<P>
<B>Chat Bubbles</B><BR>
Now when a player or NPC uses a /say or /yell chat command, it is displayed in the game screen by default as a chat bubble as well as in the chat log. It displays above the head of the character talking, but only if you can see the character. This functionality can be turned off should you desire. This functionality also exists for party chat, but is turned off by default. Both options are turned on or off in the "Interface" options window.
<p>
<B>Getting New Abilities or Spells</B><BR>
You can move the ability to your action bar by opening the abilities panel with the button in the bottom center of the screen
and then clicking and dragging the ability to your action bar.You can also use a spell or ability from the
abilities page by clicking on it.
<P>
Spells are located on the spells tab. Hit P to open your spellbook.
<P>
<B>Items with Clickable Effects</B><BR>
You can drag that item to your action bar if you want to be able to use it without opening your backpack.
<P>
<B>Conclusion</B><BR>
That should get you going. Continue to find and complete quests. Follow the NPC's instructions and consult your quest log for help. Feel free to ask other players for help if you get stuck.
