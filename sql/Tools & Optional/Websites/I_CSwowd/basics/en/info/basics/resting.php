<img src="../../../shared/wow-com/images/smallcaps/plain/t.gif" align="left">he Rest State modifier gives players a time-limited bonus to combat (PvE) experience. This frees up time for
exploring other aspects of the game without penalty, such as tradeskilling and social activities, and helps players
avoid level-grinding. Inns serve as a good place to hang up your sword or staff for the night
because they confer special bonuses. Inns also act as home locations.
Hearthstones provide a speedy way to travel back to an Inn when you need to take care of business in town,
or when you're ready to check in and call it a night.

When you are going to change Rest States within your current level, a special bar/divider will appear on

<B>More Information</B><BR>
<UL>
<LI>You start resting when you take a flight path into cities.
</UL>
<B>Why was Rest State added</B>
<OL>
<LI> Increase some sense of realism and role playing in the game by incorporating the concept of Inns and
characters sleeping.
<LI> To try to balance the speed at which various play styles level in the game. Even though World of
Warcraft has a faster level curve than many games, we found that casual players were still feeling the
"grind" in later levels. We didn't want to make the level curve even easier, since many other players
would zoom through the game too fast.
<LI> Rest State, Inns and Hearthstones all go together. We wanted to give people some limited
teleportation around the world to
alleviate some of the long travel complaints, we wanted to encourage people to go to towns and cities
through Inns, and we wanted
to balance the level curve.
<LI> It gives people an in-game alarm clock where each time you change a Rest State, you can decide
whether you want to logoff, continue or do other activities (trade skill, pvp, etc).
<LI>It reduces the pressure for every area to be perfectly balanced experience/balance wise. For example,
 in other
games it was common during any level range to go to the "perfect" grinding spot. With Rest States and
questing, the (game's) world should stay more evenly distributed.

To force people to sit in Inns. We intend just for people to log out at Inns naturally at the end
of their play session.
For some people it does give them the chance to chat and roleplay while "resting." </OL>

<B>How can I tell if I'm Resting?</B><BR>
Your player portrait in the top left corner should flash yellow. If it is not flashing yellow, you're not
in a proper rest spot such as a City or Inn.
<P>
<B>How do I check my current Rest State?</B><BR>
Your experience bar changes colors for each Rest State. You can also check your Rest State by moving your
cursor over the experience bar. A tip window will pop up showing you your current
rest state.<P>
<B>Where do I get a Hearthstone?</B><BR>
You will receive one when you check in with the Innkeeper.
