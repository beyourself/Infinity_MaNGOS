        <i>"From the moment you first set foot in the diverse lands of Azeroth, World of Warcraft captivates with its vast, seamless, and visually cohesive world. Players are placed in charge of their own destinies virtually immediately--there's no tutorial introduction to the game, whose elegantly designed interface is easy to decipher and simple to use. And, while other games in the genre punish players for testing their limits and running risks, World of Warcraft encourages this kind of activity by not forcing players to lose experience when they fail. That sort of can-do design ethic pervades all aspects of the game, allowing characters to make significant progress by playing solo or in groups, giving characters an experience bonus for time they haven't spent online with the game, and so on. It's that welcoming approach that makes this game truly special."</i>

Here is the online role-playing game you should play, no matter who you are. This is because World of Warcraft brings out all the best aspects of this style of gaming, if not many of the best aspects of gaming in general. It also features many of the specific characteristics that have made Blizzard Entertainment's previous games so entertaining, memorable, long-lasting, and successful. Of course, the company's past track record did not guarantee that World of Warcraft could have turned out this well. Such high quality simply cannot be expected, nor should it be missed."</i>

Among many notable elements, some that stand out in particular are the quest-driven gameplay, low down time, high accessibility, gentle learning curve, outstanding art direction and fairly modest hardware requirements.
