<img src = "../../shared/wow-com/images/smallcaps/plain/o.gif" width = "40" height = "38" align = "left">ne of the core tenets of the Warcraft universe is the raging conflict between the Horde and the Alliance. Old hatreds die hard, as they say, and the hate shared between these two ancient foes is deep and primal. That's why the player-versus-player gameplay has always been a staple of the design for World of Warcraft; the war between the Horde and the Alliance simply isn't over.
<p>It might not look this way now, because our full player-versus-player system isn't in the game yet, but the introduction of Battlegrounds, and the full PvP reward system, will change that perception. We've been testing Battlegrounds and our reward system for weeks internally now, and we're ready to bring you a full-blown, multi-part preview of what we have in store for you in the months ahead.
<p>

Last week, we engaged in a massive internal test of the new Battleground system, as dozens of internal testers amassed for war in the snows of Alterac Valley. Arrayed in the southern valley was the Frostwolf tribe, a proud group of orcs fiercely loyal to Warchief Thrall's standard, while at the north valley stood the doughty dwarves of the Stormpike clan, hearty soldiers dedicated to the preservation of the Alliance. In a session that lasted hours, we were able to test the latest iteration of our PvP system: High-level groups marshaled at their respective bases and then sallied forth to clash in the center of the map, trying to break into the other side's forward camp, fighting alongside elite NPC defenders. Lower-level players who wanted to contribute in other ways to the battle could also do so by undertaking PvP-related quests, such as capturing wolves or rams to provide mounts for cavalry charges, claiming a nearby mine and ferrying resources back to the main base to upgrade allied troops, or capturing enemy graveyards to lengthen the run back to the frontlines for revived adversaries.
<p>
<table @NT@ align = "right"><tr><td align = "center"><small><a href = "../../shared/wow-com/images/pvp/battlegrounds/ss03.jpg"><img src = "../../shared/wow-com/images/pvp/battlegrounds/gryph-thumb.jpg" width = "202" height = "143" border = "0"><br>Gryphon Airstrike</a></small></td></tr></table>
Just when the pitched battle seemed to be stalemated, Alliance gryphons appeared over the battlefield and began to lay waste to Horde players below, bringing another set of challenges to the battlefront. To match firepower with even greater firepower, thanks to the efforts of questing Horde players, a fearsome shaman could be heard in the distance calling forth a mighty elemental to begin a rampage of the Stormpike camp. As the battle reached its climactic conclusion, we steeled ourselves for the inevitable destruction that would come as griffon fury was overrun by elemental rage.

<table @NT@ align = "right"><tr><td align = "center"><small><a href = "../../shared/wow-com/images/pvp/battlegrounds/ss04.jpg"><img src = "../../shared/wow-com/images/pvp/battlegrounds/battle-thumb.jpg" width = "202" height = "143" border = "0"><br>Players battle near the<br>Horde Stronghold</a></small></td></tr></table>
We tried very hard to create a battle experience that felt like Warcraft; we want you to feel like you are part of a larger conflict, with the potential for lots of strategy and tactics beyond a simple mob of players crashing into each other. Our hope is that we've succeeded, and once we further fine-tune our Battlegrounds, you players will be able to experience the first of many battlefields where the Alliance and Horde will test their resolve against one another.
<p>
In the meantime, to whet your appetite while you wait, and to show you some of what we have in store for Battlegrounds, we'd like to share a little more details on Alterac Valley itself. And in the weeks ahead, we'll provide a glimpse at the very latest iteration of our PvP honor system.

<img src = "../../shared/wow-com/images/smallcaps/plain/a.gif" width = "40" height = "38" align = "left">lterac Valley itself is nestled high within the Alterac Mountains in Lordaeron. To get there, players will need to run through a tunnel in the mountains. Each side will have its own tunnel entrance into the valley. The entrance into the zone is a swirling red portal, so you'll know you're about to enter a Battleground when you see this striking sight.

Great cliffs surround the exterior of Alterac Valley, and hills and spotty trees dot the snow-covered landscape. In the south lies the Frostwolf base, while in the north is the Stormpike base. Each base is a functioning town, with vendors, smiths, guards, and quest givers. And like any other zone, there are hostile monsters wandering the wilderness. The difference, though, is that everything here is geared towards player-versus-player combat.

The middle of the map is basically a hotbed of conflict. Off to one side is a freezing cave where ruthless ice trolls reside. Within this lair, we're placing some elite loot: gear that players will be dying to acquire. However, with such incredible loot comes commensurate danger, not only from the residents within, but also from opposing players who might also come searching for treasure. One of several key graveyards is also situated near the middle (more on graveyards later). On opposing sides of this middle are the forward base camps for the two sides, with the Stormpike camp in the north and the Frostwolf camp in the south. Each is led by a powerful captain: the first line of defense when trying to break through to the other side's base.

Beyond this forward base camp are patrols of NPC guards, with some of them, such as the captain and several important lieutenants, also being elite opponents. Nestled into the mountains in each side's territory is also a mine. These mines are fiercely held ground owned by troggs and kobolds. However, inside are crates of supplies that either side would do well to acquire, for they can be used to upgrade NPC soldiers with better armor and weapons, thereby making them harder to kill and more lethal in battle.
<p>
At the opposite edges of the zone, deep in the heart of each side's territory, is a village, and just beyond that, its main fortress. You'll not only find each side's graveyard here, but also various support NPCs, including vendors, smiths, quest givers, and the ultimate commander of each side.

<img src = "../../shared/wow-com/images/smallcaps/plain/w.gif" width = "40" height = "38" align = "left">hen the Battlegrounds debut, you will be able to collect quest loot and trophies off of players you kill. For example, if you are a Horde player and kill an enemy PC, you will be able to take from them their blood. Not only will this be a trophy of your victory, but in the Battlegrounds, amassing the blood of your enemies will have an awesome and powerful effect. If you and the other players on your team bring enough enemy blood, and by that we mean hundreds, to your side's head shaman, he will begin a ritual to summon an immense elemental, which will then march methodically into the enemy camp to destroy it. Likewise, for the Alliance side, bringing enough trophies to your head spellcaster will call an equally powerful being to your side's aid.

In addition to looting blood off of a corpse to complete this grand summoning quest, when you kill a player, you will also loot an insignia off their body. The insignia looks very much like the PvP flag next to your character portrait when you are flagged for PvP. When you grab the insignia, you also destroy the corpse of your fallen foe, which means they can't resurrect where they died.

The slain player will then get a dialog box asking them whether they want to return to a nearby graveyard to be resurrected and avenge the defilement of their corpse. Once you release and go to a nearby graveyard, you will find that there is a living friendly NPC at the graveyard, not a spirit healer. Coming back from the dead is a little different in a Battleground. You cannot resurrect yourself at will. Instead, you have to wait for this special NPC to raise you, which he does with an area resurrection effect that he casts every minute or so (you will see a countdown timer on your screen telling you how long before you can come back). When the area effect resurrection goes off, all friendly dead players within the graveyard are brought back to life, with half health and mana, and no resurrection sickness or durability damage. At this point, you are free to return to battle. But how far you have to run to return to the frontlines depends on which graveyard you were raised at.

Alterac Valley will have several graveyards distributed within it. There will be at least one, if not two, near each side's base and another in the mountains near the center of the map. Graveyards are basically neutral territory that can be captured by either side, which introduces some interesting strategies to the game. Each side obviously will want to control the graveyard closest to the center of the map, so that dead troops can rush back to battle even quicker. However, an even greater advantage is gained by taking the graveyard closest to the enemy's base. That makes it even easier for players on your team to storm the enemy base, as you basically eliminate the long run across the map.

The mechanism for controlling a graveyard is through the banner that lies inside each one. A graveyard already under your side's control will have your faction's banner and several friendly NPC defenders there. The banner tells you who owns the graveyard. To claim a graveyard for your side, you have to tear down the current banner and erect your own, which is basically achieved by interacting with the existing banner. It's easier said than done, though, because a claimed graveyard will have opposing, elite NPC defenders. However, once you succeed, your allied NPC troops will begin to spawn in around the graveyard and take control of it. More importantly, enemy players will no longer be able to revive there.
